# E-Commerce Web Application

## Project Overview
The site is for an e-commerce web application. The platform is designed to simulate the user experience of browsing products, managing shopping carts, placing orders, and maintaining account settings. It provides a modular architecture, where each HTML file represents a unique functionality or section of the application.
